Redux, redux-router, webpack, sass building template
----------------------------------------------------

getting started (with hot-reloader)

```javascript
npm install
npm run watch 
```

If there are any problems with the install, might we worth running the shrink-wrapped.json instead which uses versions of packages that are working.
